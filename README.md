Welcome to __*Wanderlist*__, a travel planning && sharing social networking site!

:airplane: Made by Ruolin An, Shu Ting Hu and Maggie Yang for CPSC 304 2019W2

### Set up to run on your machine
1. Clone the repo.
2. Ensure XAMPP is set up properly. Use the instructions in Tutorial__PHP__MYSQL.pdf if you have not done so.
3. Create the advengers database in phpMyAdmin and populate it with tables and data using the advengers.sql script.
4. Drag the advengers folder into XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs.
5. Check the permissions on the file directories inside images: pfp and posts should have read write permissions for everyone, for all enclosed items.
6. Open localhost/advengers/login.html in your browser and have fun!

### Log In/Sign Up
Log in as an existing user or sign up for a free account. You can also log in as one of the existing users, the crew of advengers. Usernames can't be changed, so choose wisely!
